        <div class="about-me">
        <p>Hello, my name is Harri, I am in my final semester at San Francisco State University. Then again, the last time I thought I was in my final semester of university an entire pandemic happened and now I am here. I am officially studying Cinema but have taken a somewhat meandering path to get here, so I will happily accept any degree so long as itâ€™s a bachelors or greater. When I got my associates for transfer they looked at all of the credits I had completed and gave me two extra associates for free, and if I am honest I would love it if San Francisco State did the same. After I escape the California State University system my dream is to have a job with a pension and maybe even a dental plan. My hobbies include updating my resume, doing everything my dog asks me to, and procrastinating my homework. My most recent job was as a tour guide in the Mission District for Secret Food Tours. I also worked the Northbeach China Town combo route, but for some reason people do not tip well on that route so I always tried to trade it away for Mission tours. In that role I learned a lot about the food, architecture, and history of San Francisco, it was a great job, one I can not recommend to my friends as Secret Food Tours committed multiple labor law violations in the two years I worked with them. They owe me between $800 and $1000. When I have learned how to code I will build a website around one of my creative projects to act as a portfolio, but for now I am just trying to get the hang of things.</p>
