        <h2>My Top Five Bad Ideas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Becoming an internet psychic under my birthname</h4>
        My student loans might be looming over my head like the sword of Damocles, and my birthname might be perfect for pretending to be psychic, but that doesn't mean I should abandon my morals and take advantage of gullible strangers on the internet.</li>
            <li><h4>Giving my future kid my birthname</h4>
        While my gender plays a role in me no longer using the name "Chrystal", the actual reason I stopped using it was because I have blocked multiple pornbots with that, or similar, names on social media. Somehow, I am pretty sure that problem isn't going away any time soon.</li>
            <li><h4>Going back to the Maritime Academy</h4>

</li>
            <li><h4>Learning French at the same time as Spanish</h4>
        They are very similar languages and I already get them confused despite the fact that I barely remember my high school french classes.</li>
            <li><h4>Open a business that's basically an escape room but instead it's a Heist Room</h4>
        I have never met a small business owner that wasn't prematurely gray</li>
